##RideSync---Carpooling-App
This is a prototype for a carpooling app that is made for university students to carpool together and be assured that their driver is also a student of the same university. Based on the idea that it is very likely several day scholars could be living in the same general area so they can carpool together.

Part of my second semester project.

1. you need to resolve all the required dependencies.
2. A local database must be setup with the required tables
